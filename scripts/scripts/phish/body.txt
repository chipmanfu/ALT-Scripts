Alex,

Thank you for your recent order!  We hope that you will find the licensed copy of Atom Text Editor to be far superior to the community version.  We have saved you the trouble of a web search and added the required package to license your software and pull the new updates.  Fair warning since you are using an Apple, you might need to right click and open.  We are diligently working with Apple to be added to the App store so we can bypass this hassle.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact our customer support.

Best Regards
Atom Software
